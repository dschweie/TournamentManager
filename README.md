# TournamentManager

The objective of this project is a software which can manage board game and petanque tournaments.

The code insight this repository is not ready to use. It is only stored to keep it under version control and as a backup.

The official language in this project is German. I deliberately chose the language because I understand this project as my hobby and many participants from my circle of acquaintances work on this project. Should it be a problem for you to write issues in the language of the language, then it may also happen in English.

The interface of the application is developed bilingually from the beginning so that additional languages can be provided easily. Anyone wanting to contribute here should be a native speaker in the language he wants to add.
